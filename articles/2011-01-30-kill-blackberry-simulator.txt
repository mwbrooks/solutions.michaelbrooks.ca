On Windows Vista x64 and Windows 7 x64, I have trouble closing the BlackBerry 4.x and 5.x simulators.

In the end, the only way to close it is by killing the task.

To speed the whole process up, I use a `kill-blackberry.bat` file that I shortcut to my desktop or quick launch bar.

Happy task killing!
