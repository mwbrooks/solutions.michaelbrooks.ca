Error Message
=============
Compile-time error related to `_fopen$Unix2003`.

Solution (OS X)
===============
In my experience, this is related to using a library compiled with the 10.6 SDK on a project that is compiled with the 10.5 SDK.

Recompile the library with the lower SDK or compile the projector with the higher SDK.

Untested Concern
================
I am not sure if the platform matters (i386 or x64)
