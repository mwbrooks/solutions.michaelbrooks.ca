By default, when an application is closed on iOS 4.x, it will suspend and not terminate the application.

You can opt out of suspending the application with a simple `Info.plist` setting.

1. Open your Xcode project
2. Open Info.plst
3. Add a new entry with the following KEY:VALUE pair `UIApplicationExitsOnSuspend : YES`
